"""Step 5b: the model explains what the rules could not.

This layer sits BEHIND nlpcc/explain/rules.py and never in front of it. The
ordering is the whole design:

  * A rule-matched finding never reaches the model, so the common cases are
    instant, free, identical between runs, and reviewable by a human.
  * Only findings no rule covered are sent, and whatever comes back is
    labelled ``explained_by: "llm"`` so the report can mark it as generated
    rather than authored.
  * Every answer is cached on disk by diagnostic code, so the second run of
    the same program costs nothing and works with the network unplugged.
  * Nothing here can fail the pipeline. No API key, no package installed, no
    network, a rate limit, a malformed reply -- each leaves the diagnostic
    exactly as it arrived, and the CLI goes on reporting it without an
    explanation.

Each answer the model gives is a candidate for promotion: an explanation that
turns out to be right belongs in rules.py as a permanent rule, which is how
the deterministic layer grows.
