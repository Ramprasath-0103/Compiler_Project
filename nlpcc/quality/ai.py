"""AI code analysis -- the diagram's analysis stage.

Reads the program and reports problems across the same five dimensions the
rule engine uses. It runs alongside the rules, not instead of them: the rules
catch what they know and always work offline, and this catches what no fixed
threshold can describe.

Runs on whatever model is available -- a local one through LM Studio or
Ollama needs no API key at all (see nlpcc/models.py). Optional either way: no
model, or a reply that does not parse, leaves the analysis exactly as the
rules produced it. Each finding records which provider wrote it.
