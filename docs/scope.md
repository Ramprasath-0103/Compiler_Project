# Scope contract

Settles what this project builds and, more usefully, what it does not. Every
other document defers to this one. The subset grammar below is settled; the
quality dimensions are the remaining gap.

## Decided

**Our own front end, with clang as ground truth.** We implement lexical,
syntax and semantic analysis for a C subset. clang runs on every file as well:
where it reports something we miss, that is a tracked gap in our analyzer, not
a feature we outsource. Programs outside the subset still get full analysis
from clang, so the tool is useful on day one and the compiler-design work is
genuinely ours.

**Rules before the model.** Explanations come from a reviewable rule table.
The LLM is an enhancement layer for unmatched findings only, and its output is
labelled as model-generated. Non-negotiable: the demo must work offline and
two runs of the same input must produce the same report.

**Quality scores must be explainable.** Every point of the score traces to a
named rule with a published weight. No dimension is scored by asking a model
for a number — "readability: 7/10" with no derivation cannot be defended.

**C only.** One language, done properly.

## The subset grammar — settled

This is the contract the front end implements. `nlpcc/frontend/parser.py` has
one method per rule below, named after the rule, so the parser reads as this
grammar does. Anything not derivable here is outside the subset: the parser
emits one `W_OUTSIDE_SUBSET` note, skips the construct, and clang's findings
carry that file.

Notation: `{ x }` is zero or more, `[ x ]` is optional, `|` is choice,
`'x'` is a literal token, UPPERCASE is a token class from `frontend/tokens.py`.

Three additions to the proposal, each forced by a program already in the
corpus rather than by taste: storage classes (`static int add(...)` in
`clean.c`), the wider arithmetic types `double`/`long`/`short`/`signed`/
`unsigned` (`double temperature` in `semantic/format_mismatch.c` — and
`tokens.py` already lists those keywords), and `sizeof`
(`malloc(1024 * sizeof(int))` in `security/unchecked_malloc.c`). The proposal
is otherwise unchanged.

**Deliberately outside the subset**, each producing one `W_OUTSIDE_SUBSET`
note and no further complaint: `struct`, `union`, `enum`, `typedef`,
`switch`/`case`, `do`/`while`, `goto`, function pointers, varargs (`...`),
multi-dimensional arrays, compound literals, and `#define` expansion.
Pointers are in the subset only as far as declaration (`int *p`),
dereference (`*p`) and address-of (`&x`) — pointer arithmetic beyond array
indexing is not analyzed. See `tests/corpus/subset/` for the case that pins
this behaviour down.

**The semantic analyzer sees no headers.** `#include` is recorded, never
expanded, so names from the standard library have no declaration to find.
`nlpcc/frontend/semantic.py` therefore carries an explicit table of standard
names (`printf`, `malloc`, `NULL`, …); a file that includes a header outside
that table has undeclared-identifier reporting switched off for the whole
file, because a false "undeclared" on correct code costs more than a missed
one. clang still reports it.

## Settled during implementation

### The five quality dimensions

Implemented in `nlpcc/quality/`. Thresholds live together at the top of
`nlpcc/quality/rules.py` so they can be reviewed in one place; weights are in
`nlpcc/quality/score.py`.

| Dimension | Weight | Rules |
|---|---:|---|
| Security | 30% | unsafe function use, unchecked allocation, leaked allocation |
| Readability | 20% | nesting depth, function length, opaque names, comment density, repeated literals |
| Maintainability | 20% | cyclomatic complexity, parameter count, mutable globals |
| Performance | 15% | allocation in a loop, call in a loop condition |
| Practices | 15% | return-count, plus every compiler error and warning |

**How the five combine — the open question, answered.** A weighted mean alone
was wrong in both directions, so two caps sit on top of it:

1. *A critical security finding caps the overall score at 60.* This was the
   case the question named: `tests/corpus/security/unsafe_strcpy.c` scores 100
   on all four other dimensions and still cannot exceed 60, because it has a
   buffer overflow.
2. *The overall score may not sit more than 20 points above its weakest
   dimension.* Measured need, not theory: `quality/deep_nesting.c` scored 93
   "excellent" under a plain weighted mean — five levels of nesting and four
   meaningless parameter names, averaged away by four clean dimensions. Quality
   is a weakest-link property, so the headline now follows the worst dimension.

Compiler errors deduct from the practices dimension, so a file that does not
compile cannot score well on quality.

Every deduction records the rule that made it (`Score.contributions`), which is
what makes a figure defensible when someone asks where it came from.

### Report format

JSON is the single source of truth (`Report.to_dict`); Markdown is rendered
from it. Nothing reads another renderer's text, so a number can only be wrong
in one place. No PDF — a Markdown file prints.

### The model layer and its offline path

Claude (`claude-opus-5-5`) via the Anthropic SDK, in `nlpcc/explain/llm.py`,
strictly *behind* the rule table: only findings no rule matched are sent.
Answers are cached on disk keyed by the diagnostic's shape with
program-specific names stripped, so repeat runs are free and work offline.
Missing package, missing credentials, no network or a malformed reply each
leave the diagnostic untouched rather than failing the pipeline. Results carry
`explained_by: "llm"` so the report can mark them as generated rather than
authored. `NLPCC_OFFLINE=1` disables the layer outright.

Every model answer that proves correct is a candidate for promotion into
`nlpcc/explain/rules.py` as a permanent rule. That is how the deterministic
layer grows.

### How generated code is validated

As the question proposed: it has to pass through this pipeline first. Step 9
compiles every generated program, and on failure hands the model our own
plain-English diagnostics and asks again (two attempts). Code that still does
not compile is returned marked unaccepted rather than printed as though it
worked.

## Still open

- Persistence: SQLite is chosen but nothing is stored yet. What is kept —
  every analysis, or only reports?
- Should `tests/test_corpus.py` let a case opt into the quality pass with a
  `"quality": true` key? Today the three quality cases are covered by
  `tests/test_quality.py` instead, and stay marked pending in the corpus.
- The executor's containment is a timeout and a scratch directory. Anything
  beyond a local CLI needs rlimits, no network, and an unprivileged user.

## Explicitly not building

PostgreSQL, multi-language support, IDE plugin, anything reachable over a
network. The CLI is the deliverable; the React frontend in `frontend/` is a
local view onto the same pipeline, and its API binds to 127.0.0.1 only
because it compiles and runs submitted code.
